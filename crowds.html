<h3><center>Park Occupancy Can Impact <br> More Than Ride Wait Times</h3></html</
center>

<p>
Determining the <b>busiest days</b> at Disney's Magic Kingdom can vary based on a 
variety of factors including time of year, holidays, special events, and <u>promotions. Historically, the park tends to be busiest during peak 
vacation seasons such as: 


<li><b>Summer Holidays:</b> Especially around July 4th (Independence Day) and Labor 
Day</li>
<li><b>Spring Break:</b> Typically March through April.</li>
<li><b>Thanksgiving:</b> The week of Thanksgiving, especially the day before and after 
Thanksgiving Day.</li>
<li><b>Christmas and New Year's:</b> The weeks surrounding Christmas and New Year's 
Eve.</li>
<li><b>Weekends: Due to guest having free-time.</li>

    
Disney World employs various crowd management techniques, such as tiered ticket 
pricing and advanced reservation systems, to help distribute crowds more evenly 
throughout the year. So, while these times may historically be busy, the park 
implements strategies to mitigate overcrowding.
