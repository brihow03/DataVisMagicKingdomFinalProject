<p><b>Project Inspiration:</b><br>
  Disney World, known by many, as the most magical place on earth is my family's favorite vacation destination. With several trips under our belts, we still find ourselves discussing how to make the most of the time we spend together and the time we spend in the park. Every trip has been different and we’ve found ourselves loving some aspects while pledging to avoid others. The search to maximize our Magic Kingdom adventures has led us here. My goal is to identify and research key factors that impact our visits to the park to minimize stressors and maximize fun. The primary factors I’ve identified are; cost, crowds, and ride wait times. This is my Final Project for DATA Science course 303 DATA Visualization.

<p><b>Project Development</b><br>
  I was not able to locate online datasets or other automated means of extracting the specific information I required for my analysis. I did find the information needed to create the .csv files needed to process the information and create my charts. Data sources used to compile this information were cross-checked with official Disney World websites or its authorized affiliates. The web addresses for their locations can be found below in Source information.
